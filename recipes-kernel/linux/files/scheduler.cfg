# System scheduler and timing configuration for real-time audio
# Improves scheduling precision for low-latency audio processing

# Set kernel timer frequency to 1000Hz for improved scheduling precision
# Default is typically 250Hz, this provides 4x better timing accuracy
CONFIG_HZ_1000=y

# Disable kernel scheduler tick on CPU 3 to reduce jitter
CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y

# Remove RCU callbacks from CPU 3 for cleaner execution
